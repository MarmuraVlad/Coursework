The action of the film “Alpha” begins its development more
than twenty thousand years ago, when our planet was a harsh, 
cold and uncomfortable place. Death lurked here at every turn. 
The survival of a person depended on his ability to cope with the victim. 
A group of primitive people goes on a hunt, which from the very beginning 
is not developing according to plan. Something goes wrong and as a result 
one of the tribe is fighting off its kinsmen.
The young hunter does not know what to do and understands that he was alone
 with the cold and hostile world. And now he needs to find out the current situation.
 But the problem is that he is young and does not have enough survival experience.
 Every step he takes is a new danger, and any careless movement can lead to death. 
He will have to face his own fears, because only in this way he will be able to muster 
courage. His life is at stake. From the outcome of his journey depends
 not only his fate, but also the lives of many tribesmen.
