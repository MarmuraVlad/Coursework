Fantastic action movie "Avengers: Completion"- this is the
 continuation of the movie "Avengers: War of Infinity"
 and 22 on the account of the film Marvel Cinematic universe.
 The upcoming film and the release date were announced in 2014.
 A year later it became known that the directing of the
 third and fourth parts of the Avengers would occupy Anthony and Jo Rousseau.
 Writing the script was entrusted to Christopher Marcus and Stephen McFeily.
 In the pair, they created the cartoon series Agent Carter
 and wrote scripts for up to 11 films, of which 5 relate to
 Marvel's cinematic universe. Producer of Marvel films Kevin Feigie
 said that it was planned to shoot both aesthetic films at the
 same time - this would reduce the cost of organizing the process.
 The same thought was also directed by Anthony Rousseau,
 but later he stopped at the fact that the films would be removed
 one after another. Immediately before the shootings of the action
 began immediately after the filming of the previous part of the film - in August 2017.
 The work lasted until January 2018 and was held in Atlanta, Georgia.
 Among the actors is the characters who died in the first
 part of the film, but none of them is shown in the trailer and movie thiers.
