The film's action takes place in New York . The main characters are
 three friends Artem, Igor and Oleg, a real "Russian" Finn, nicknamed "Sauna".
 All three are about thirty, they work in a foreign country, while in their
 free time they break off, "as adults": go to the sauna, to strip clubs,
 to spin short, and not to compulsory novels. Sex for them has long turned
 into a run for short distances, tempted women - in trophies, and
 triumphal victories - the main theme of the discussion during each couple's party.
But once the case interferes with their steady, carefree, unhealthy life ... 
At the next party in one of the clubs a person looks like a glass and raises
 a toast: "Let what you drink for it will be impossible without what I drank."
 It will take very little time, and all three will find an unpleasant 
change - they can no longer have sex.
How to restore male power? Ginseng root? Viagra? Thai massage?
 Sexuality counseling? Nothing can save. For what? Why? And why is
 it so early? And why are we? With these questions, our heroes in
 desperation run by experts ... In the end, they learn that the person
 from the club is an angry Saint Valentine, and he, using his mystical
 abilities, "encoded" them from disorderly ties. They will save only
 one remedy. Love. And sex will be. But only with a beloved woman.
 There is a small matter - find it ...
